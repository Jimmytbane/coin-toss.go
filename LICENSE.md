The JimmyBot License.

NOTE:

I grew tired of trying to understand long licenses other than the BSD 3 Clause license, yet I needed some of the conditions, so I made my own license. It is very similar to the BSD 3 Clause License, but has small changes and 2 added clauses, or "conditions".


DEFINITIONS:

"Free Software", when mentioned in this license does not mean free of cost or price.
We are working with the FSF's definition of Free Software from here: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html

“Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”. We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.
